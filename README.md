## About 
This app listens for voice commands, interprets them using speech recognition and natural language processing thanks to the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API), and then sends the extracted information to a mock API. It simulates how a smart assistant would receive and process spoken instructions to trigger actions or update data in a backend system.

##  Getting Started

## Usage
